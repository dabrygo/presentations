    \item ``Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a game where two players
      choose an item from the game's title and compare results. 
      The winning results are:

      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rps_win.png}
      \end{center}
      Furthermore, when the players' choices are identical, the result is a draw.
      Program this logic in Python.

      \textsc{idea}: Use \texttt{random.choice} to randomly choose an element
      from a collection.

    \item The Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_n = F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}$, where
    each element is the sum of the two previous and the first two elements are
    $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$. The sequence starts like:

    \begin{center}
      1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, \ldots
    \end{center}

    Complete this function to find the nth Fibonacci number:
    \begin{verbatim}
      def fibonacci(n):
        return 
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{enumerate}
